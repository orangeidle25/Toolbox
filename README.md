Toolbox is a set of tools developped by orangeidle25. It was developped in Python, and is available for Windows users. I do not plan to add MacOS and Linux support, as multiples functions are Windows-exclusives and can't be run on other systems without specific software. Note that Windows 8 or higher is required. The list of available tools is listed below.

- Timer
- Stopwatch
- Calculator
- Notepad
- Password generator
- Unit converter
- Currency converter
- QR Code generator
- Alarms

More tools will be added in the near future, along with new features for the existing tools.

Thank you for supporting my project, orangeidle25 ðŸ’™
